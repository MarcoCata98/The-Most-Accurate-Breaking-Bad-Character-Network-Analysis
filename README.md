# The-Most-Accurate-Breaking-Bad-Character-Network-Analysis

This repository presents a graph-based network analysis of character co-appearances in *Breaking Bad*.  
Characters are modeled as nodes and co-participations within episodes as weighted edges.  
The project includes network construction, visualization, and centrality analysis to study narrative structure and character importance.

**Data collection note:**  
The dataset was manually extracted by analyzing the series frame by frame.  
No false pairs are present: the network includes **all and only** the character pairs that actually appear together in the series, with the exact number of co-appearances.
